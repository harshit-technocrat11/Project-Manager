## This is my first FULL stack project ( using the MERN stack ) 
#### -> it is a project mangement platform having the key feature of sending email notification ( being  the owner of the project ) to invite members
#### Yes the UI/UX needs improvment and it could have been better, but everyone starts small ... Looking foward to build awesome projects in future!!
#### Loved the backend Architecture ( my fav part ) --> will aim for building scalable Backend Systems in upcoming projects.

#### my motive , to build this project was to understand the entire flow, of building a fullstack web app, 
#### how Frontend <-> Backend integration works, and 
#### Ofc , the Balls it takes to build a something while facing nasty , filthy errors , debugging and getting obsessed ;)

#### my focus will be on building solutions for Business problems, Hackathon PS, + integrating GEN AI ... 
#### Godspeed!
